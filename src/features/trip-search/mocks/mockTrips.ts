    description: "Happy New Year! Super excited to start 2026 at Sant Pere - it's going to be amazing sharing this first ride of the year with fellow kiters!\n\nEach person can bring:\n\n- 1 large kite bag (2-3 kites inside)\n\n- 1 twin-tip board\n\n- 1 small backpack (for food & water)\n\n- pls, do not bring a board bag\n\nI can also let you know closer to the trip if we have space for more kite bags.\n\nIf you have a special request (i.e. extra detour or extra luggage), ask BEFORE you book.\n\nThanks",
